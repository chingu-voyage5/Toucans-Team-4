# Toucans-Team-4

# Introduction
Welcome Ladies and Gentelmen to our learning project for the Chingu Cohort Voyage 5.<br/>
For this Voyage we have decided to recreate a complete clone/copy of the TickyBot landing page.<br/>
Even though this is a clone/copy, we will still attempt to add our own personal flavor to it.

# Links
The original landing page can be found at: https://tickybott.herokuapp.com/<br/>
Our clone version can be found at: https://github.com/chingu-voyage5/Toucans-Team-4

# Documentation
The main stacks that were used to complete this project was HTML/CSS & JavaScript. <br/>
At the same time, we also decided to sprinkle in a few other things into the project to help make everything a bit more organized.<br/>
The extra sprinkles that we used were: Node.js, Gulp, PostCSS, BrowserSync and a few others.

# Team Members
The team consits of three highly motivated and skilled learners each with different sets of skills that they contributed to the completion of this project.
